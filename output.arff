"impolite","Phones generally don\'t even ring for more than 30 seconds. Why do you want to do this?"
"impolite","And this is why you\'re asking all the stupid questions?"
"impolite","wait! If you\'re doing the thesis, shouldn\'t you be the expert?"
"impolite","I\'d like to know why someone voted to close this as Off-Topic.  Can you please explain your reasoning?"
"impolite","It\'s a pretty dumb question.  Who is asking you this?"
"impolite","Yea the password isn\'t the same as the lock code and on another note, she needs a better pass code! If you have contacts and pictures synced she could just setup as a fresh phone?"
"impolite","What is wrong, are you making a comment to Elderathis answer, or are you adding your own answer? If you\'re adding your own answer please expand a bit on this, I don\'t believe the base Clockworkmod can help you unless you\'ve previously done full ROM backups, or follow the links on Elderathis post to get hold of the approriate ROMs (stock or custom)?"
"impolite","You *want* to see your password in your cookie? I suppose you like it when sites email you your *forgotten password* too?"
"impolite","WTF? Downvotes? What for?"
"impolite","You again? Why don\'t you go do your homework?"
"impolite","You wouldn\'t be allowed to ask and post comments if you were not logged in. What kind of programmer are you?"

"impolite","Ugh, possibly the ugliest Python code I\'ve ever seen. What are you doing?"
"impolite","What exactly do you want to know? Equipment tips, location tips, landscape photography tips?"
"impolite","Wow.  You couldn\'t even format your test question correctly?  How can we answer your homework for you if you can\'t even format it well?"
"impolite","Sorry @klox I don\'t understand. Could you explain a bit more?"
"impolite","You can do just about anything with one pin of a micro.  More specific please?"
"impolite","IIRC, this is the same problem as with volume buttons on some ThinkPads... the hardware *just does it* and then also sends out a signal saying the button\'s been pressed.  Possibly you could unset the shortcut in System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts for this action?"
"impolite","@I Never Finish Anythi madness would be great Fun. How do I get infested by madness?"
"impolite","Except here is where the action took place, so here is where I questioned it. How about you answer it?"
"impolite","This is a pretty broad question. Can you be more specific, please?"
"impolite","Maybe he wants to know why *usually* angular velocities are characterized by vectors and rotations by matrices. Is that your question?"
"impolite","@pimvdb, No I don\'t. Do you have something which could lead me to a solution or just wanna make some pointless comments?"
"impolite","How ridiculous is the answer you\'re looking for? Do you want a 3-layer solution, with `i % 3` as a configurable business logic?"
"impolite","What do you mean by \""how to charge\""? Are you asking how much money to charge or how to implement an ad service and payment gateway?"
"impolite","Wait  you\'re writing a thesis and you\'ve got *no clue how to use it*? Wow. Usually, it should be the other way round, shouldn\'t it?"
"impolite","You\'re talking about computing the coefficients of the polynomial, right?  Is this equivalent to computing the product of $sqrt{n}$ $sqrt{n}$-bit integers in time $tilde O(n log n)$ (where $tilde O$ hides sub-logarithmic factors)?"
"impolite","You think mapping strings to a variable\'s symbolic name is a good idea?  Why in the world would you think that?"
"impolite","Why not? And why on earth do you have these absurd constraints?"
"impolite","Must you go through all of the cities? Must you use all of the tickets?"
"impolite","Ya, seriously.  17 questions and no selected answers?"
"impolite","I notice that many questions you have asked are simply available through a Google search. You do know about Google ?"
"impolite","\""non-default screen resolutions when using virtual display over screen sharing\"" ?????a statement, not a question. Please: do you *prefer*, or wish to *avoid* the non-default resolutions?"
"impolite","what exactly do you have in mind? Sampling or search applications?"
"impolite","Is there a reason why all of you on here seem to be anti-car? I would find this amusing, but highly inappropriate behavior from our mayor in Seattle. Why is it something to laud here?"
"impolite","What in the world are you talking about? Is this a legal question (use of copyrighted images)?"
"impolite","That\'s a lot of complicated code for something which could probably be shown a lot more simply. Care to provide a much simpler example... and an actual *question* to go with it?"
"impolite","You should change the title to a question. Maybe something like \""What is the most popular Dictionary Application for Ubuntu?\"""
"impolite","I suggest re-titling the question, as this has nothing to do with ebay.  Perhaps a title like \""How can I secure my PHP website?\""."
"impolite","And what is your question? Surely you don\'t expect a solution, as then you wouldn\'t have been doing your homework?"
"impolite","There seems to be a problem when attempting to obtain and parse the list of video devices, the Java engine crashes. What problems did you have with Skype, also iSight related?"
"impolite","You might want to add some comments on what you mean by early game as this term is often confusing and interpreted differently. For example, at about what supply are you expecting the Marauder push?"
"impolite","Not even proper sentences? Are you currently in an exam?"
"impolite","This isn\'t a question about LaTeX or friends, but about installing texlive. Perhaps move it to super user?"
"impolite","@Moron : I am not here to get my work done, but to learn better ways from other people, and perhaps help them if I can.   BTW ... Why are YOU wasting your time with that comments?"
"impolite","An empty inbox?  What\'s that?"
"impolite","What exactly do you want to interpolate? What is the resolution and distribution of your measurement points?"
"impolite","This is tough because personal environments are usually already customized, so apples-to-apples comparisons are hard to come by.  To start, you might indicate what your system is (Ubuntu version, hardware) and even include a relevant benchmark for your current set-up?"
"impolite","This same question was asked almost word-for-word about two hours ago. Hasn\'t anyone ever heard of Google?"
"impolite","I don\'t understand your reference to \""Appid\"". Are you able to clarify a bit more?"
"impolite","@Jason: You\'re a harsh man. Millions of people also disagree it seems - go watch the show?"
"impolite","Boy, am I glad I don\'t have to eat your salmon. No offense, but I detest fennel, while I think dill is perfectly fine. Why would you want your fish tasting of licorice?"
"impolite","If its your homework you should possibly do it yourself. Have you even tried it?"
"impolite","SO answers homework questions too? Really?"
"impolite","I don\'t understand. If you had your problem solved ... why did you post a question?"
"impolite","@H.B.: Any chance the `f` was a unicode character instead of a standard f?"
"impolite","Did you try anything at all? Is this homework?"
"impolite","And what operating system? and why on earth are you writing this in assembler?"
"impolite","\""Not a real question\"" ? What is the \""not real\"" part here?"
"impolite","Open a console and run `badblocks` as well as `fsck.ext4`. Do those programs report errors?"
"impolite","**0% acceptance rate?** Really?"
"impolite","@Oli Because I believe that you\'re a troll, could you please not take part in any form in any of my future questions? Will you be able to respect my wish?"

"impolite","I\'m not understanding \""The first paragraph of http://www.ctan.org/starter.html needs an update.\""  How, please?"
"impolite","I don\'t want to type my credentials in again. Couldn\'t you just give me an admin role and handle the authorization in your code?"
"impolite","lol, WHAT? sry not making fun of anyone but this is hilarious the way it is asked?"
"impolite","Does this only happen on multiplayer? Or does it happen on single-player too?"
"impolite","@Francesco: Why are you so against sharing the errors that you are seeing. Why don\'t you get that they are helpful?"
"impolite","What have you tried and where are you stuck? Or are you just asking *us* to do *your* work for you?"
"impolite","any code? or do we have to guess at how you did it?"
"impolite","...have you considered implementing it yourself? You *are* a programmer, aren\'t you?"
"impolite","Why -1?
what wrong with ppl here?"
"impolite","You question is very incoherent. Can you ask it more clearly?"
"impolite","can you post an example for \""language fieldset\"" on user-edit page, please?

I\'ve created mymodule.module and pasted your code above, what to write in // Change $form array to alter form components? :)"

"impolite","Do you mean multiple categories of blogs?  Or multiple discrete blogs like CNN\'s blog site?"
"impolite","Just to be a bit of a stinker: your title isn\'t really a question, nor is it a good indicator of what you\'re actually asking. Consider revising?"
"impolite","Do you want a yes or no answer? Is this homework?"
"impolite","Hello, Vladimir Alexiev; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which Drupal version are you interested?"
"impolite","You\'re doing two times the same thing (2xforeach) and the previous variant might just overwrite the option if the not set in $_REQUEST. Probably this is the issue?"
"impolite","I have also seen people recommending tasksel. Maybe someone could explain what this one is good for too?"
"impolite","What error? We should guess?"
"impolite","show some code ? what u mean not work ?"
"impolite","@Ranieri, what would you suggest? JSON?"
"impolite","This problem is trivial to solve. Is this homework?"

"impolite","cuz then it wouldn\'t be a BINARY search.  Any more obvious questions I can answer for ya?  :)"
"impolite","you are not giving us **nearly** enough detail to answer your question. First things first - is this a top down game, isometric, side scrolling?"
"impolite","I know it is only after V3, but will there be at least the ability to retrieve the mod flag messages, or a count of the number of moderator flags at some point? Also will you at one point be willing to review the moderator ability features?"
"impolite","According to the error message the second line of the file `/etc/apt/sources.list` is invalid. Could you please post that line?"
"impolite","Doing a redundant `atoi` after you just did `strtol` is probably the most twisted insult to the proper use of string-to-int conversion functions in C one can come up with. Why do you see the need to \""re-convert\"" the value using the broken function `atoi` when you already have it as `val` from a proper function `strtol`?"
"impolite","Is Google Voice actually a Web App? Or is it more a smartphone app?"
"impolite","Do you have a specific question?  Or just, *\""Here\'s my homework, please do it for me?\""*"
"impolite","So... you want to implement an exclusive decision tree without using if/elif? Why???"
"impolite","What is the actual question? And have you considered using punctuation?"
"impolite","You do `global $post`, but at the time `content_save_pre` runs, no `$post` object exists (since you are right before saving it). Could this be your problem?"
"impolite","What kind of edging are you using?  quarter round?"
"impolite","What are you uploading the images for? Is it something that your theme will reference, or something that you want users to have access to and to be able to re-use images that you already posted in their own content?"

"impolite","do you own any C++ books? if yes then why dont you try searching this in that ?"
"impolite","Also, I seem to be missing that GPS checkbox from the settings interface... After Review i see Shutter Sound which should be on the next page according to the screenshot above. Any clues?"
"impolite","You could specify whether you need an introduction on applied statistics, or one on (theoretical) statistical inference. I.e., do you want the framework of testing, regression and ANOVA explained or do you want to know what the central limit theorem and the inequality of Chebiyshev have to do with the weak law of large numbers?"
"impolite","This is a vague question. Do you even consider the payment and billing cycle dates?"
"impolite","it was a joke. why so serious?"
"impolite","Could you cite a reference please? Is the rule based on the noun closest to the verb?"
"impolite","You tags are misleading - Algorithm, data structures and in your question you are asking for an answer to the puzzle. what do you want?"
"impolite","You can\'t imagine any circumstance in which you would need a simple front end to enter information into your db? Really?"
"impolite","Sounds like a good homework question.  Does your instructor know you\'re cheating?"
"impolite","Subjective and argumentative?  Really?"
"impolite","*\""Obviously\""*. Why not?"
"impolite","Wow that is a vaguely described problem. Could you please ... give us some of the code you\'re having issue with?"
"impolite","\""Bike tires don\'t need tread to handle rain.\"" Excuse me? Since when?"

"impolite","I\'ve re-read the question at least 4x\'s now and am still confused, re: if your manager has great faith in your development skills, why isn\'t your manager giving you senior-level responsibilities? Or is it just the title you are seeking?"
"impolite","This seems OT?  @LBushkin, do you think this would be the right site for this kind of question?"
"impolite","Menu->options->keybindings?  Is that not working for some reason?"
"impolite","You do realise that it\'s not likely to be much cheaper unless you rebuild the wheels yourself?"
"impolite","They are completely different. Have you even glanced at the documentation?"
"impolite","No matter how efficient you are it is going to take a looong time to enumerate through 2^100 subsets of vertices, and that is before you get into the fact that edges can be there or not.  Can you switch to a problem that is likely to finish before the Sun explodes?"
"impolite","You didn\'t answer the question though - why single speed rather than fixed? What prompted the choice (after 8 years, didn\'t you ever consider the option?)"
"impolite","This sounds bizarre.  Can you explain WHY you have to do it this way?"
"impolite","I\'ve never been able to get Mail.app to use the Exchange account that Google provides for mobile device use. Any chance they\'re using Google?"

"impolite","Are these whole frozen crab, crab legs, or crab meat?  Is it pre-cooked or pasteurized?"
"impolite","Can you clarify what \""down\"" means? Have you turned on the display of error messages to see if anything is generated?"
"impolite","homework? or you write software for Somali pirates?"
"impolite","So what\'s the problem? If you can read from server, then you don\'t know how to read if from local file, do you?"
"impolite","I don\'t get it. Are you asking us to try and predict the future?"
"impolite","So what\'s the question? Is it \""will you do this homework for me\""?"
"impolite","What benefit will you gain if we do your homework for you? Why don\'t you do it yourself?"
"impolite","Sure, we tell you some good ideas, you make mad money.  Are we suckers?"
"impolite","Could you tell which packages you have already tried? Would something like a long table, where you type each paragraph into a cell, be useful to you?"
"impolite","Why did you make this community wiki? Why are you refusing to read the documentation?"
"impolite","I\'m sorry, as this question is written I have no idea what you are actually asking. Can you revise and expand on what you\'d like to know?"
"impolite","So? Are you expecting us to do your homework for you??? :-) Ok,here\'s a hint... what\'s the type of `\""a\"" | \""b\""`?"
"impolite","To clarify, are you asking \""pros and cons... of using SSL?\"" or \""... using SSL for the WHOLE site as opposed to just login page\"" or something like that?"
"impolite","@RPM1984: its just so utterly wrong though! You seem like a smart guy, where did you get the idea from?"
"impolite","Homework?  Because there doesn\'t seem to be any other remote possibility in my mind why any sane person would want to do this?"
"impolite","Why not K&R? Was this just an excuse to bad-mouth some books you didn\'t like?"
"impolite","Could you provide a *minimal* example that reproduces the problem? Do you really need to load all those packages to get the bug to kick in?"
"impolite","What? Can you say what you question is in one sentence?"
"impolite","@antti.huima Why? Because you can\'t solve it?"
"impolite","Ow my eyes. Why are you not using `use strict; use warnings;`?"
"impolite","\""Loops are forbidden\""?  What sort of nonsensical assignment is this?"
"impolite","@Rajendra: I have read it carefully, and both the original problem and the converted problem can be interpreted in multiple ways. Is it that hard to give a yes or no answer?"
"impolite","Yep, Google, first hit, then read the paper cited. If you don\'t know what it is, then how come you know you want to implement it?"
"impolite","While this may not be your homework, you are essentially just asking us to write you code to solve this problem. Maybe you should do a Google search?"
"impolite","@Kory, please elaborate, on what grounds do you suggest that? What do you suggest the problem is?"
"impolite","Surely your classes have at least introduced basic entity relationship modelling to you already?  I can\'t see them giving you this project without some kind of basic coursework...  Are you sure this isn\'t a case of just skipping read the textbook/lecture notes?"
"impolite","That\'s what groups are for.  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/auth/#groups Why aren\'t you using groups?"
"impolite","So you think it\'s a good idea to dump your homework here without any attempt at solving it from your side and expect us to do your work? Also: which assembler language are we talking about?"
"impolite","The name of that site is \""CodeKata\"" not \""Code Katas\""; \""can anyone ..\"" is a yes/no question, what you really want to ask is \""what are some more ..\""; the title \""Code Katas\"" is too short and is automatically rejected by the system; greetings and signatures (\""thanks!\"") are currently considered out of place on SO (see Meta); the [best-practices] tag is out of place, and [coding] (at least [currently](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coding)) has lost any specific meaning (effectively all programming involves \""coding\"", right?)."
"impolite","Error 500 means, that connect to Apache is working, but something behind it does not.

What can you see in /var/log/apache2/error.log after trying to see the page?"
"impolite","To suggest an answer we need to know which application you want to open this file in. Is it a command line application (aka vi or emacs on the command line) or is it another text editor (TextEdit, TextMate, Eclipse?)"
"impolite","you asked this same question a couple days ago http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3595256/simple-pseudocode-code-question .  Did you not like the answers you got?"
"impolite","hmmm.. nothing???"
"impolite","Hmmm... I suggest you try and solve them yourself, and then post questions back on SO with your attempted solutions. Just asking people to do the work for you kind of defeats the purpose, you know?"
"impolite","*\""There\'s this funny gap I tried to write a paper once upon a time when I studied linguistics???\""* ?????I think there\'s an \""on\"" or \""upon\"" missing. :-) You probably meant \""???I tried to write a paper on once upon a time\""?"
"impolite","Does anyone know how to estimate a difference in difference regression in gretl? Do I have to work with OLS or panel data?"
"impolite","What is the problem? To identify the liars?"
"impolite","Clues? Any code???"
"impolite","Wow! How has no one recommended SharePoint? Or is that telling in itself?"
"impolite","@Darin Dimotrov: So you\'re saying that if I sent you to the supermarket to get me some beer, you will tell me you can\'t buy beer in a supermarket, while you actually *mean* you don\'t know which brand of beer to buy and whether to buy a single can, a sixpack or a tray. Would\'t it be better to just ask more specifically what I want, instead of telling me it\'s impossible?"
"impolite","I use the [full-size version](http://training.perl.com/scripts/rename) of the rename script everyday.  Why in the world would you *not* want to use existing code?"
"impolite","The insertion of data into the hash seems to have nothing to do with your original creation of the hash. Why are you so reluctant to show us your code?"
"impolite","As @Woot4Moo points out, you have already asked this question AND received decent starting points in the replies. So what have YOU done?"
"impolite","Its not a homework people, my colleaugue asked me to help him with some algorithm, this is only a part of that, I simplified it in terms of normal array objects, anyways the data consist of approximately 1000 elements, so if you could help us with atleast a better( efficient algorithm).
and who tagged this is as homework??"
"impolite","If you have never got it working, why should you do it everyday? Did I miss something?"
"impolite","One idea: don\'t. Why do you think you need to do this?"
"impolite","Please post the relevant lines from the log.  Do you intend for these commands to run as you, or as root?"
"impolite","pardon my ignorance, but what is a \""game matchmaking service\""? Is it like eHarmony for avatars?"
"impolite","*What* doesn\'t work? How so, and what do you actually want to do?"
"impolite","I don\'t understand your example, but I\'m also not a new user. How about some examples of shortcuts/commands you haven\'t been able to come up with a mnemonic for yet?"
"impolite","well... where is the problem? what results *are* you getting?"
"impolite","If you had such a list, what on earth would you do with it? The list of names in each category doesn\'t seem very interesting by itself; surely you don\'t want to actually process the content of all those grammars?"
"impolite","You have a web service for multiplying numbers? What for?"
"impolite","Shouldn\'t every professional programmer be able to do such things? Isn\'t that part of a being programmer?"
"impolite","I can\'t help but think that you\'re making this much more complicated than it should be.  HTML already handles word wrapping beautifully, why would you manually add line breaks to text that has characters with dynamic width?"
"impolite","I\'ve updated the question to specify that it\'s verbal feedback we need to record (sorry for the ambiguity). That noted, would such a system work with a member of the team adding clients\' comments on their behalf?"
"impolite","Is there a \""trap street\"" or \""Fictitious entry\"" in it? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_street otherwise you can probably get away with violating any copywrite?"
"impolite","this has nothing to do with C#.  Why did you add it as a tag?"
"impolite","Why are you debugging AutoCAD? Isn\'t that AutoDesk\'s job?"
"impolite","Title say permutations, but body says combinations. Which is it?"
"impolite","@badp I\'ve noticed you often use acronyms that I either need to look up or someone has to have you define for them.  Maybe you could consider typing things out instead?"
"impolite","Besides this isn\'t asking for a web app solution, rather a server side solution.  Off Topic?"
"impolite","I don\'t see anything strange in the log you posted. What do you expect `NSTokenField` to do???"
"impolite","That\'s a straightforward formula that uses basic arithmetic operations.  What part don\'t you understand?"
"impolite","This question basically tells me nothing about what the actual problem is. Also, what\'s a \""pathway\""?"
"impolite","exact duplicate of your 5 minute old question [How to receive and use a json in ajax sended from php?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4317587/how-to-receive-and-use-a-json-in-ajax-sended-from-php). Are you for real?"
"impolite","iPhone 3.3? Do you work for Apple or something?"
"impolite","Thanks, Anu. Sorry to be a php nitwit, but I tried this and got nothing: \'<?php wp_get_post_terms(\'20\', \'toolkit\', \'description\') ?>\'  should I have left it as \'<?php wp_get_post_terms($post->ID, \'toolkit\', \'description\') ?>\' ?"
"impolite","@littleadv and what\'s so strange? if I have this program running over bilion times, what\'s so strange, do you mind answering?"
"impolite","Post you linked to also has non-edit filter solution by Otto. Had you tried that?"
"impolite","sounds suspiciously like homework.  if it is, what have you done to solve the problem yourself?"
"impolite","Who would be helped by this?  Is all that work really going to help someone?"
"impolite","Um. What do you want to replace them with? And, maybe a little context would help, no?"
"impolite","Is \'find . -name *.c\' not simple enough?"
"impolite","what\'s wrong with this place? how has this question been up for an hour and no one has made a Bob Ross reference?"
"impolite","Um,oops... sorry for editing your question; thought I was editing an answer. Want me to pull that down into a comment?"
"impolite","Not at all clear what you want to do. What is the full expected output?"
"impolite","Those sound more like rhetorical questions than actual questions. What are you looking for?"
"impolite","*\""I am going to be developing a real-time web application\""* - good luck with that! How are you planning to get around the internet latency?"
"impolite","It\'s my understanding that it is not possible to change a file\'s ctime without royally screwing everything else up. Why do you need this behavior?"
"impolite","What? No warning that gender can change?"
"impolite","oh sorry mr. wizard yeah i meant math in general - can i change it somehow?"
"impolite","I see no question here. What is your question?"
"impolite","so what is your problem? You don\'t know how to copy the content?"
"impolite","this is source code... what is the question? Do you really think that throwing code at us will solve your problem?!"
"impolite","Updated!!!!!!!!! any one???"
"impolite","Vote down? Would you care to explain why?"
"impolite","Of the two answers, you chose to accept the one with 3 downvotes vs. the one with 7 upvotes?!"
"impolite","Nice project. Got any videos or pictures of the output?"
"impolite","For source control reasons? Can you please explain?"
"impolite","There already a bunch of free IDE out there, and you want to use Visual Studio ??? You have arguments to not use Eclipse or Netbeans ?"
"impolite","I didn\'t know that you had to use an email address instead of a username. When did that change?"
"impolite","Apple => i = 0 => B[i + 101] = B[101] = \""0069\"", not \""0041\"". Am I wrong or are you?"
"impolite","Also are you complete sold with VSFTPD? Or would you be interested in other types of FTP softwares like pureftp?"
"impolite","Consider rephrasing your title. \""How complex is the documentation you write?\"""
"impolite","That is an interesting problem, but would be time consuming and costly to determine every possible result.  Why not create a buffer?"
"impolite","What platforms are you talking about?  Does it have to work across platforms?"
"impolite","What problem are you trying to solve? Are you sure cron is the right solution?"
"impolite","Of course I am not comparing to anything else. Otherwise, I won\'t be here, right?"
"impolite","You just did! What are you asking that your query doesnt already do?"
"impolite","Which views version are you using? Are you using the views-7.x-3.x-dev with the new UI?"
"impolite","\""Cant see the error\"" ? You mean your compiler crashes as badly on this code that you even can\'t tell us what he is complaining about?"
"impolite","Um, why are you doing this with Javascript? Is that really going to be the way to put things into the database?"
"impolite","Hmm.. the price probably depends on the Apple store (e.g. for me prices show in Euros) Which price should we note?"
"impolite","could you give an example, please. What oportunity do you mean?"
"impolite","Wow! Trivial answer converted to comment! Is this new?"
"impolite","No this is security. (what would server fault have to do with injection?)"
"impolite","Sorry what has blender to do with game engines? do you want to use its format?"
"impolite","Isn\'t it? Homework is work too, or are you only allowed to get answers for free if you are actually payed to find them yourself?"
"impolite","Since when is `String` a primitive? Since when can you store primitives in a `Collection`?"
"impolite","Stopping code is completely different from debugging code.  What\'s the real question?"
"impolite","Okay, you simply posted your homework verbatim. Do you have a question of your own?"
"impolite","Did you build the wheels for your car on your own, or you bought the ready ones from the store? If you didn\'t reinvent the wheels literally, why are you considering it metaphorically?"

"impolite","Sure, done.
(what\'s up with these 15-character minimums?)"

"impolite","Why would this be homework? And what if it was homework?"
"impolite","As you can see from the answers so far, it\'s not quite clear what context we\'re talking about. Could you please clarify?"
"impolite","-why- not use sorting? homework?"
"impolite","While this doesn\'t ring a bell, I find the second paragraph of this question very confusing. Perhaps you could make it a bit clearer?"
"impolite","Huh? A downvote? What for?"
"impolite","Why not just leave it in the fridge? Do you really need easy quick access to the butter?"
"impolite","@Gabi: what is the point of having n greater than say 32 or 64 ? It seems like an arbitrary and unnecessary requirement ?"

"impolite","Do you mean something like \""Intrateam 30-minute meeting\""? Or does it have to be one word?"
"impolite","@Michael: What purpose does this serve besides being a list of milk? If it\'s just a list of milk, is that really useful?"
"impolite","Out of curiosity what are you actually trying to accomplish? To put it another way, _why_ do you want to do this?"

"impolite","@space_cadet: Thanks for your answer.I have two question for you.Could please let me know how the conterfactual states are generated in the first place and what is the role of alpha s in getting rid of them?Because I\'ve always just been taught that measurement gives each possible state with probability Tr(Pi_alpha rho) for different possible projections and we never talked about inconsistent states!

"impolite","why they have to in ONE page? why not use CSS sprites?"
"impolite","In general, in questions like this it would be very useful to specify what kind of thesis you are supposed to write: For example, BSc, MSc, PhD, something else? In particular, are you expected to do new research or \""just\"" organise existing knowledge?"

"impolite","Your code will result in 0.5. So what\'s your problem?"
"impolite","Why the vote to close? Is this offensive to you?"
"impolite","@BCS - A computer-controlled analog EQ sounds oxymoronic to me. Please correct me if I\'m wrong, but won\'t any digitally controlled pot be, well, digital, and the microcontroller and/or pot introduce switching noise when you change the pot\'s value?"

"impolite","@Guffa What exactly should I do to make it absolutely clear that I don\'t care what for my vote is used aside from the fact that it lets the OP know that his / hers way is the best in my opinion? Would you stop making remarks if I upvote your post?"

"impolite","Why did using VirtualBox not work? Did you set up the networking correctly (adding a host-only adapter to the VM)?"
"impolite","Yeah, and why don\'t it try to convert \'abc\' to int and add to 1? Apples + Bananas gives you what?"
"impolite","Ah, I agree that \""comes with\"" is misleading. But the remote administration client binary (to which I assumed he was referring) isn\'t called Remote Desktop?"

"impolite","someone? anyone?"
"impolite","According to your comments to some of the answers you don\'t want to use neither locks nor interlocked operations, yet you want the operation to be locked. How do you think you can achieve licking without using, well, locking?"

"impolite","Dont get you. Looks exactly the same in IE9 and FF5.01 on Windows 7?"
"impolite","Emulating how a fish \""thinks\"" is the way to get it really right, worse you can\'t even start on a rough heuristic until you know what a \""fish-like swimming path\"" *looks* like. Do you even have a way to judge how you\'re doing?"
"impolite","Apparently, you correctly answered your own question: The watch window gets the value of a variable by calling its `ToString` method. So, what\'s your *actual* question?"
"impolite","I\'m a little confused by the title, but I don\'t know much about corn varieties.  I know candy corn as [this sweet confection](http://www.reagantales.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/candycorn1.jpg); is there a variety of corn that is grown that\'s commonly referred to as candy corn?"

"impolite","but how?
where will i write the code snipt?"
"impolite","Agreed, show us what you have and seek clarification on the hard parts. You won\'t get far asking people to do your homework for you (how would you learn?)"
"impolite","Why are you using exec? And what\'s wrong with passing in a string or file?"
"impolite","Oh, how I hate such changed behaviour...^^ Why would you do that? If you write a letter in word, would you expect it to save the text in a file when hitting enter or should it begin an new line?"
"impolite","No, it is not needed. You know a penalty box was made for the kind of behavior you\'re exhibiting right now?"
"impolite","The link here in your question is giving me a database error; did you paste it incorrectly? Also, if you solved it, could you please post your solution here as an answer? :)"
"impolite","You also seem to have \'Web\' there twice. Which browser are you using, and do you have any greasemonkey scripts or plugins which may be breaking the links?"
"impolite","I\'m sorry, but it\'s still not clear.  Are you saying that it _is_ correct grammar?"
"impolite","`transistors`?  `transistor-level`?"
"impolite","I suspect that `\'apt-get install libpq-dev` didn\'t work properly, as the 9.04 distro is no longer supported (too old). Can you run the `pg_config` command?"
"impolite","That\'s correct behavior.  What don\'t you like about it?"
"impolite","\""given the following program:\""  I see no program.  did you forget to include something?"

"impolite","Thank you for this code.But when I put it in my file the title \""Table of content\"" doesn\'t change. Could you help me, please?"
"impolite","I would say that it has nothing to do with the language, but with programming. Since this is homework, I suppose that you should know at least something about this subject?"
"impolite","This sounds like a job for the listings package, really. Could you post an example of your code?"
"impolite","Career advice questions like this one are too localized for this site. Please see [Are Career Advice questions useful for anyone except the poster](http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/588/are-career-advice-questions-useful-to-anyone-except-the-poster/590#590)?"

"impolite","What do you mean with \""it doesn\'t work\"" ? Does it crash (which I suspect, given your code), does it show the wrong images, doesn\'t it do anything at all ?"
"impolite","I gave a working answer, just scroll down to read it. Who is going to accept my answer?"
"impolite","I tend to prefer amsmath `begin{equation*}` over `[`, because it feels more semantic and makes the source more human-readable. But I really don\'t know, is there any difference between these two?"

"impolite","I am not sure if I understand, it seems to me that your short answer contradicts your second answer. And, could you please provide an example of how can I use hyperref to do this?"
"impolite","yes. ambiguous dates are of little value to the intended audience. When is the cutoff for an app or library to be considered?"

"impolite","Hey EAMann, that\'s great and it works. However, I\'m having trouble echoing the Title, can you put an example of how to do that please?"
"impolite","Will you have enough RAM to run the system off RAM (i.e. you can load a big compressed archive at boot time), or must it run from the flash card?"
"impolite","Why \""arrested\"" in the title? \""Given a ticket\"" makes more sense, I would think?"
"impolite","1st of all, I think `string` is a reserved word, and shouldn\'t be used. Second of all, have you tried debugging with console.log?"

"impolite","Seems like a very odd design for web applications. Would you mind to explain why MVCC does not work for you?"
"impolite","The hash is used (often) to capture state, while a URL (as its [definition suggests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator)) is for **identifying a resource**. So again, why would you push a non-existent url into the browser\'s history?"

"impolite","Also, why are you calling \""use Inline\"" three times?  Where did you get the idea to do this, and why not just call it once?"
"impolite","Why do you want 50 threads? And what is it that they are supposed to be doing exactly?"
"impolite","This sounds like homework. Also, Lisp is built around recursion, why do you want to avoid it?"
"impolite","@Andrew I beg to differ, the examples aren\'t good enough to explain what he wants. It\'s like saying \""I need *something*, for instance a car, so can you help?\""."

"impolite","When you say that the Sharpe ratio is the mean divided by the sample standard deviation... \""Up to a constant factor (sqrt(n), where n is the number of observations)\""... what does this last part mean?  Is it really the mean divided by the standard error of the mean?"
"impolite","@Monish If you don\'t know how to implement modes of operation, you shouldn\'t be implementing your own crypto code. Why not use an existing library, like KeyCzar?"
"impolite","What do you mean it \""did not work\""?  What happened?"
"impolite","I\'m always amazed at how many questions are similar to this. Are people itching to write code like this?"
"impolite","\""think I\'ve pointed out something that is not yet satisfactorily proven\""?  What have you pointed out that\'s not proven formally?"
"impolite","Seems like a rather big project. From what I can read, you have no experience in programming?"
"impolite","I wonder what difference it will make to your prompt? A few milliseconds cannot cause problems, can they?"

"impolite","You do realize this is an example? And that Ruby find this problem at RUNTIME?"

"impolite","what exactly are you expecting to see?  more than 1 server?"
"impolite","For me, there\'s a fairly large gap between \'a web map\' and a \'web-based GIS\': a simple map with layer control and panning is great for many applications, but doing analysis through the web is a different scope which many web maps don\'t attempt to solve.

"impolite","Your shortcode definition is `frame_left`, code examples use `frame_right`. Can I assume you have `frame_right` shortcode defined in same way?"
"impolite","I am attempting to ask what I see as a fundamental question.  Maybe I should have asked, \""is it true that there is a fundamental computational complexity for certain math that cannot be avoided?\"""
"impolite","It would help if you described what your ultimate goal is. Do you really expect a given multigigabyte media file to have any resemblance to another multigigabyte media file?"
"impolite","Are you using cheesecloth, and worried because the finer particles get through and settle out? Or are you just running it through a sieve and seeing small cracklings still floating in it...?"
"impolite","You say \""My solution involves a tree\"", but surely that doesn\'t fall under the \""using only bit manipulation\"" criteria, does it? As such, it\'s not really a solution is it?"
"impolite","Did you change the Document type, or is it the standard one used by Drupal? Which error does Firebug report?"
"impolite","You ask and answer your own question? Or am I completely missing out on something?"
"impolite","Is this a exercise in ideology? Views is very well suited to this task, why not use it?"
"impolite","Give us more details about your setup. Are you using Wubi, Partitions, or haven\'t even started yet?"
"impolite","Sorry, I should\'ve made it clearer there are other text, figures and tables contained within leftbar as well - I omitted them because this was a minimal example.  So that doesn\'t appear to be an option for me...  Any other ideas Stef, or others?"
"impolite","Oh, be nice. Seven months, surely? :P"

"impolite","you will certainly find something on the spec. Have you tried?"
"impolite","Your question, as it stands, is difficult to understand. What do you mean by \""referred to\"" ?"
"impolite","Testing is an art more than a science. Before you go off and read a book, tell me - what are you trying to accomplish?"
"impolite","What do you mean by missing file songs? Do you have items in your iTunes library that are non-existant of your hard drive?"
"impolite","Ruby doesn\'t even have an official spec, so I doubt that there\'s a properly correct answer. In any case, why do you need to know this?"
"impolite","@Brian useful != possible. The question was, what is possible?"
"impolite","homework? perchance?"
"impolite","Why exactly would a space-inefficient trie be too slow? Are you expecting to load more data than available memory and thus creating many page faults?"
"impolite","This is subjective/asking for a list of things.  Can you make this a CW?"
"impolite","well, what are you getting instead? What is the problem?"
"impolite","Could you please elaborate on the problem ? What is happening when you try to access some https site ?"
"impolite","Can you explain what you are trying to do? The *whole point* of the Null Object Refactoring is *not* to use `nil`, so why would you want to inherit from `NilClass` for that?"
"impolite","@Kangkan: you\'re getting awfully technical, on a slippery road... Does the application effectively _knows_? Does the application exist outside of the computer?"
"impolite","Really annoying default behaviour. How did you disable it?"
"impolite","So this *is* a trick question, right? Or am I just completely useless?"
"impolite","The C specification says tm_years is \""Years since 1900.\""  Why not just stick to the standard and avoid this whole mess?"

"impolite","How about some screenshots? (Hmm, does stackoverflow have facilities for that?)"
"impolite","Sorry, I wasn\'t sure as you said you\'d upgraded from 10.10, so I didn\'t know how \'fresh\' your install was. Are you using nouveau or the proprietary drivers?"
"impolite","There is no answer without a specific question -- how is your code not working? What does the data look like that is being parsed by `split`?"
"impolite","Do you have a specific geodatabase in mind or are you looking for general material. Same for Python: Are you looking for ESRI specific material or more general?"
"impolite","You need to further explain this question to get a good answer.

"impolite","WHy would you need a dummy line to put a breakpoint on ?  When can\'t you use an actual line ?"
"impolite","You should know that adding the tag \""homework\"" to your question still doesn\'t convince many people to do all the work for you. Could you at least show us what you came up with so far?"
"impolite","This strikes me as a rather weird use of templates.  What is it that you are trying to achieve?"
"impolite","Sorry I should have asked it in more accurate words...yes I meant that it should be measured with respect to the aircraft\'s instantaneous position and not velocity... Would the cross-track wind measurement/direction change if it was measured with respect to the aircraft\'s \'airspeed\' velocity than \'groundspeed\' velocity? -- as the cross-track direction is effectively perpendicular to the instantanous velocity of the aircraft -- whether measured wrt to ground or air -- so its measurement/direction would not be infulenced by the aircraft\'s velocity... no?"

"impolite","@belisarius done. clear now?"
"impolite","Your title says \""sorted array\"", but you ask about a BST in your question? Is this homework?"
"impolite","Isn\'t that a bit of an odd measure? Would you choose to become a factory worker because it\'s *easier* and *faster to learn*?"
"impolite","Lol -- +1. What **compiler** are you using?"
"impolite","Under \""normal\"" circumstances, that space shouldn\'t be there, unless explicitly added. Can you please add to your question a [minimal working example](http://www.minimalbeispiel.de/mini-en.html) illustrating how your footnotes generate the extra spacing?"

"impolite","Why do you want to disable either Javascript or cookies, or both?  What benefits will that provide?"

"impolite","You can\'t create a geodatabase in ArcMap, unless you are referring to the ArcCatalog window inside of ArcMap.  Did you mean a 9.3 version of an .MXD file?"

Would they say the same thing to people using SQL Server?!"
"impolite","@:closers: why off topic? Mind to explain?"
"impolite","Thank you, I will give this a try tomorrow but could you please explain how to do different validations. For example validating for an correct email address, validating that there are no more than or at least XX characters, that a form field is filled out... things like that?"
"impolite","Still references are quite informative. And nevertheless even if it is discussive and mentions something that is not present in the book it is some kind of a clue, isn\'t it?"

"impolite","looks like problem with xorg or video driver. does it happen outside of the terminal?"
"impolite","I don\'t know these tools, but re: *Ability to restrict password cracking* - I doubt that\'s what you mean - you really can\'t prevent someone from trying to crack a password hash, since it can be done on other machines.  Do you mean restricted access to the password hashes?"

"impolite","karthick, that was a great answer. Could you please add some info on OCRFeeder to mark it as the accepted answer?"
"impolite","Why do you need to store the whole graph in memory? Can\'t you serialize it to the datastore in a fashion that makes querying it practical?"
"impolite","No worries dude, we\'re all here to learn :) Yeah you\'ll most likely need to set your normals. Have you just tried darkening the colour from white to a grey and see if that shows it slightly better?"
"impolite","If so, that\'s a hell of a perf hit to take just to show the user a moving progress indicator. Why not just show a spinning ball or similar while the file is copying?"
"impolite","What does this have to do with programming?  Are you trying to solve this problem with a program?"
"impolite","I think you need to describe better what you\'re trying to do.  You want to break up the string into substrings of a certain length?"
"impolite","sorry, no idea what the code should do. Is the selected in the db or what?"
"impolite","but that won\'t work. - please be specific, why people should guess?"

"impolite","\""doing math on the file as if it were one long number\"" sounds like a bad idea!  What method is this?"

"impolite","Does it REALLY have to be IrfanView? Why not a free library like FreeImage or ImageMagick?"
"impolite","A module that is causing a fatal error because it\'s invoking a method of a non-object is clearly a bug in a module; it\'s difficult to say which module is causing the error, as the error is appending in a Views file, but it could depend from a parameter passed to a Views function from another module.

"impolite","qsort does sort lines in increasing order, but your definition of \""increasing\"" isn\'t the same as everybody else\'s.  Why do you think it\'s more logical to sort strings by length rather than by alphabetical order?"

"impolite","@David, No, I don\'t. Why do you ask?"
"impolite","This question does not seem to make sense. You say both ends are routers, so assuming you set the routes correctly, and the routers are gateways, what is the question?"

Is their a solution for this?"
"impolite","is this a kind of Homework? and put some code that you have tried ?"
"impolite","Sorry, I don\'t really understand what you want it to do. Why would you hold it to your ear while dialing, and what does that have to do with vibrating on answering a call?"

"impolite","@Sorin: If it\'s just a simple script, then why do you need \""syntactic sugar\"" at all? Is it pure vanity (*\""...but I want it to work this way because it looks much nicer\""*) or is there any technical reason that you cannot simply use the methods that are already there?"
"impolite","Could you provide more details , the summary of that question seems to be that special characters are ignored in google search which applies to this case. Is this the start of an expression ?"
"impolite","Perhaps this is best seen as a way to structure the design of a large-scale digital circuit (just like it might be a good idea to use subroutines in a large-scale computer program), and not really as a formal lower bound?

"impolite","Unicode contains only four double-struck Greek letters: ???????????? (????????), and since the Unicode repertoire is quite comprehensive (and much larger than the Comprehensive Symbols List), I\'d conjecture that this character is very uncommon. Could you give an example where this character is used?"
"impolite","it seems you are posting some parameter named `imagename` from your code, and you are trying to find path of that parameter ?? confusing, Or  if you are uploading the file and you want the path to file from client????"

"impolite","Why do you want to use those? What are you trying to do?"

"impolite","Also, you\'re not really asking a question by just posting some unfinished code - you need to be more specific. Is there something you don\'t understand about how the code works?"
"impolite","Why not using `isnan()` from math.h? Any specially reason?"
"impolite","There is no need to swallow initial whitespaces of lines; they are ignored anyway. Can you please edit your answer accordingly?"

"impolite","\""If any database errors occur, they will be emailed to the address specified here.\"" Do u get any emails??"
"impolite","At first blush this question seems purely mathematical: visualizing the function has nothing to do with the distribution of its arguments.  However, the reference to \""heteroskedasticity\"" suggests you\'re really trying to visualize an object that is more explicitly represented as $f(x_1, ..., x_k) + epsilon$ or more generally as  $g(f(x_1, ..., x_k), epsilon)$ where $epsilon$ is a zero-mean random variable and $g(z,0) = z$ for all z.

"impolite","Also, that photo isn\'t showing up for me. Can anyone else see it?"
"impolite","Yes, I had to wait about 18 minutes or whatever it was, in that time I forgot to come back and accept it.

Do I always have to wait for these flood checks?"

"impolite","I\'ve updated the plugin a few times on numerous blogs and never had to re-enter the API Key.

"impolite","What is a metapackage?  Is it a format?"
"impolite","You seem to have an algorithm that works. What\'s the problem?"
"impolite","@BoltClock: I\'m pretty sure that algorithms are part of the \""programming\"" subject. Strictly speaking an algorithm is not a program, of course, but are we really going to throw out all the questions on searching and sorting methods, on the grounds that \""quicksort is an algorithm, it has absolutely nothing to do with programming\""?"
"impolite","I don\'t think anyone\'s going to be able to help you based on that information alone (considering we don\'t know what `0x306aeaa5` is). Can you post your code and tell us what the exact problem is?"

"impolite","Is there an explicit reason you can not simulate data yourself (i.e. why you can not make your own gold standard and see how changing reference systems impacts this)?"
"impolite","Finding the min/max of a sequence is at worst a linear operation. How did you come up with something quadratic?"
"impolite","Why are you using jQuery here in the first place, it doesn\'t seem to be doing any good. Can\'t you just output the name inside the element directly?"

"impolite","@astony: *in a single step, you could transfer at least one point from element to its neighbours*.  Do you mean **at most**?"

"impolite","Accepted! @Rory, one more thing - can you add a line about using the *right* hashing algorithms?"

"impolite","Link? Is this homework?"
"impolite","And as I\'ve said already, look at how Apple do it. Have you looked at how CoreDataBooks works?"
"impolite","Yeah, why do you have multiple HTML files in one file in the first place? Wouldn\'t it be easier to remedy that?"
"impolite","Yes. It references the static in A just fine, just not in B. I see why this is a problem since A may have no visibility to B\'s statics. I\'m asking if there is another way to do this?"

"impolite","Hyphenation in English is a pain (and worth a PhD thesis or two) but I remember learning the Castillian hyphenation rules in school as a child, so it would seem to be much simpler (unless I\'m missing something, of course).  Is hyphenation in Asturian all that different from Castillian?"
"impolite","Stating which model of MBP you have will help, as the architecture changes over time. Assuming Unibody, at least?"
"impolite","The last sentence looks a little contradictory. Does it copy your generated config and then overwrites it?"
"impolite","Also, how do you know it failed? You get an error message?"
"impolite","I don\'t think there\'s any \""optimal\"" way to do it other than just scanning the string looking for the delimiters.  Perhaps _you_ could code that yourself?"

"impolite","Where exactly are you stuck? What doesn\'t work?"
"impolite","@MAK: Well, there is a problem **what order to store in**, and then there is a solution that specifies one way to solve the problem with its own advantages and disadvantages. Not `algorithm` -worthy?"
"impolite","Your current solution may work but doesn\'t make sense to do it that way just so you can skip typing a class name.  What is the problem with using the class name?"
"impolite","This question is too vague. Please could you make it clearer exactly what it is you are asking?"
"impolite","can you please add the output from the `add-apt-repository` command ? Also after running `apt-get update` can you please run `sudo apt-cache policy nginx` and post the result ?"
"impolite","you mean as if you\'d print screen it ? or what?"
"impolite","You may be experiencing [bug #732677](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bcmwl/+bug/732677). Can you please edit your question to include the output of `sudo lshw -class network` and `lsmod | grep -E \'b43|ssb|wl\'`?"
"impolite","I would suggest you reconsider if using the `*` selector is a good idea. Maybe what you want to do is possible without iterating over the zillion elements that make up a production web page?"
"impolite","Why is your code stored in a `.cpp` (C++) file, while the question is about C? So, what is it C++ or C?"
"impolite","@Rippo: Tried it and it doesn\'t work. Isn\'t the `$form.find(\'.person\')` supposed to find all elements that have the `person` class inside the form with `personas` id?"
"impolite","I don\'t really get the logic. What\'s similar about [2] and [5] and what\'s equal about titles...?"
"impolite","Could you clarify what you mean by \""go into\""? Why don\'t you explain what you want to happen?"
"impolite","We need no code to reverse a string. And, who would need a reversed string anyway?"

"impolite","If you wrote the CGI script, then you know how that script determines where to put the files and how to name them. What is stopping you from adding that information to a database?"
"impolite","You want *all* the paths? You want *all simple paths containing at least two members of the subset*?"
"impolite","Could you share the relevant information with us *irrespective* of whether it is an exception, and error, or something else?  Also, what does because I must there KeyPairValuOfStringAndCarType mean?"

"impolite","How do you come up with 57? Are you allowed to divide by 2?"
"impolite","Your question reads as if you\'ve already found a solution. What is the problem?"
"impolite","Because different different languages have different strengths and libraries already written for them. If I wanted to write lots of set up code for this problem, why would I pick a dynamic language, why not give myself more work and code in Java or C?"
"impolite","Why not just generate the autocompletion configuration based on your YAML file? The options won\'t be changing all the time so why bother trying to make the autocompletion configuration dynamic?"

"impolite","That\'s an odd dimension for the height.  You\'re sure it\'s not 80\""?"
"impolite","Smells like homework. How far did you get?"
"impolite","I\'d guess it\'s an archaic past tense of \""to owe\"", i.e. \""Which you owed yesterday\""?"

"impolite","What do you mean *excluding the $ and $*? What $ and $?"
"impolite","I\'m not 100% clear on what you\'re asking, but I suspect there\'s one crucial idea that when you get, everything will fall into place.

"impolite","What are you trying to get exactly?  If the list is just 2 tickets with priorities 3 and 5, what do you want to find?"
"impolite","If you do it once, you can keep using it again, and again, and again... In any case, \""looks great\"" is really a subjective thing. Can you be more clear on what you actually want?"

"impolite","Why are the results bad? Can you elaborate on what you did?"
"impolite","feel free to share the specifics of the space, it\'s quite relevant to the question. Is the space\'s shape odd, or is it hard to get to, or what?"
"impolite","What do you mean by \""more sophisticated\""? Functions that take word boundaries into account?"
"impolite","Your title mentions relativity, but your question body does not. Could you resolve this for us please?"
"impolite","Well, what do your current results look like?  Is the glow you\'re talking about from the high brightness images having spillover (ie, pixels that would be black or dim in faster exposures are accumulating more light from nearby light sources in the slower ones, throwing off the HDR processing?)"
"impolite","What\'s the benefit of the horizontal dropout? Is it safety? Is it just a style? Is it ease of maintenance?"
"impolite","Interesting. Are these log-based analytics or something like Google Analytics?"

"impolite","Is your problem that you don\'t know why the cost of the cycle 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 is 37? Or is it that you don\'t know how to do the backtracking?"
"impolite","@dan and sri, Sorry if this is too far from the original question, but is there a manner of linking (ie. the type of URL I use in my post) I can use to attempt to maintain the header (I\'m *imagining* some `rel=` attribute to the effect of the capturing it), or does HTTPS always strip it out?"

"impolite","Are you running the latest update (10.5.8 or 10.6.5?). Is \'bluetooth devices can wake up\' enabled?"
"impolite","Maybe it\'s necessary to phrase this another way: is there any food that *everybody* can eat?"
"impolite","How do you mean \'sorting a string\'?  Do you mean sorting a list of strings?"
"impolite","Could this be sublimed to something that is best described as a development manifesto? Is that what we should, essentially, be looking for?"
"impolite","I can, but it is written in Lithuanian language, so I think you woun\'t understand. Anyway, where should I put it?"
"impolite","Does it do anything other than deselect it?  That seems a little redundant, why not just uncheck the checkbox?"
"impolite","I\'ve never tried comparing them, but I\'d be very surprised if you saw a difference. Isn\'t the SQL engine going to optimize this for you?"
"impolite","Wouldn\'t R and C just be fixed numbers? What error are you getting?"

"polite","It sounds (no pun intended) like you are looking for some sort of shock sensor (accelerometer) to detect the impact of the kick.  The problem that I see here is how do you limit the impact detection to just the kick event and not detect the impact of the foot/boot on the ground?"

"polite","Could you be a bit more specific? What do you mean by short key for scroll?"

"polite","I added two. Happy? ;-)"
"polite","Wow, that thing looks awesome!  Is it quick/easy to attach?"
"polite","This has since been part of the site. Is it still useful?"
"polite","Ah, I see. If you don\'t mind, I\'ve more or less understood everything, but just wish to inquire about 2 things: (1) could you please explain the `$form_state` variable a bit more; and (2) I\'m guessing that `$job_node->field_number[0][\'value\']` writes that value to the first webform field?"
"polite","Can you clarify the question? Are you asking why member variables must be declared outside the scope of a function, or are you finding that your constructor isn\'t working as expected?"
"polite","@q0987 If that\'s the case, then you\'re leaving out some crucial information. Perhaps you could tell us why you think it\'s wrong as that might reveal what you left out in the question?"
"polite","Okay, so you just want to get a feel for what\'s out there, and know you want CCK-like functionality.  Any other specific features you\'re looking for, or aspects of Drupal that you\'d like to avoid?"
"polite","Well, when you call `new Class();`, it returns a pointer to the location of that instance of the class. Is that what you are referring to?"
"polite","You may want to post the code right here. Maybe use pastebin or something if it\'s too much to embed directly in your post?"
"polite","Can you give us a simple, dummy example to explain what you\'re trying to do? eg give us an example of a batch of the kind of repeated text/html you\'d hope the code would catch?"

"polite","\""Too localized?\""  How does that apply to this question?"
"polite","When you say concatenate, do you mean overlay them (put them in the same place) or put them next to each other?  If you mean overlay, what do you want to happen when two pixels are at the same spot -- how do you want transparency to be handled?"
"polite","Not sure, but maybe you want a clustering alorithm, e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering?"
"polite","Any luck in figuring this one out?  Were any of the diagnostic steps in my answer useful?"
"polite","Have you tried running it from the command line? `softwareupdate --list` to see if it spits out any errors?"
"polite","Hmmm... it works!! Any reasonable explanation to why??"
"polite","Alright Mike - its been already posted on light house. Would you guys need any other things from me to recreate the error?"
"polite","Needs more context. Can you provide the question which precedes the answer too?"
"polite","Wow what a brilliant and crazy question! Can I ask what you\'re going to do with it? Candlemaking?"

"polite","I\'ve tried reading about them but most of the websites I\'ve stumbled on don\'t really explain how one should actually use these. Do I just need a class which wraps my record header/data and then overloads << and >> to use these?"
"polite","Why the hell was this migrated from SO? What made them think it belonged here?"
"polite","Do you want to turn off thumbnails on just the desktop, or in folder windows (e.g. Places -> Home Folder) as well?"
"polite","Good idea.  I am wondering, will this compromise the moistness of the meat?"
"polite","Please, give some more information. What have you tried, and what error/behavior did it give?"
"polite","yes you are right I guess the problem is really whats happening around release, (I just wanted to ask if this is fine to do). Actually it\'s related to cocos2d before release I am making a CCAction and I have a CCSprite *sp, I am simply doing [sp runAction:anim]; while the animation is running I am releasing it, though nothing happens to the animation visually but is it right?"

"polite","But still, what do you want to measure with CV and in what purpose? To get a cutoff of attribute number?"
"polite","Is the crack getting bigger?  After you fix it, what happens when you say it comes back?"
"polite","Is this happening in development only? Is it possible that class reloading is the issue as classes are not cached in development if you are adding methods during execution the class could be reloaded without your newly defined methods?"
"polite","Please present your work: what have you done to debug the Count signal? How do the other signals in the design behave?"
"polite","Also, your question is a bit unclear to me. Can you provide an example of what `array` could be?"
"polite","Can you describe the problem in more detail?  Maybe upload a screenshot or two?"
"polite","Could you please elaborate that? Does it work as I think: you append the databases, then use scan>check duplicates ?"

"polite","Those look really cool! Do you keep it at the same temperature as your eggs?"

"polite","Should be \""expect\"" instead of \""respect\"". And also, please see my added question \""Do I have to know about Escher and Bach?\"""
"polite","can you explain more please ?"
"polite","@cb Please note that some angles are not cyclic: the approach angle in the original question is a good example.  If you have a specific follow-up question, why not post it?"
"polite","Great question. Perhaps it should have the pronunciation tag?"
"polite","I agree with J_A_X on this one.  Just a suggestion though, have you thought of using Flex rotate effects to do this?"
"polite","These are the SC1 hotkeys, but it is tagged and titled with SC2. Which one is the mistake?"
"polite","I\'m sure also. Would you show me a better way to do this?"

"polite","+1, awesome problem.  BTW, do you mean \""You have %d unread messages\""?"
"polite","First 30 days or last 30 days?  Nothing seems to start at 0, is that just a side-effect of the first day traffic/questions spike?"

"polite","I\'m not really sure what you\'re looking for that pinvoke.net doesn\'t provide.  Can you cite an example where it didn\'t give you what you needed?"
"polite","Are you open to programmatic solutions (e.g. custom renderers), or solely OOTB methods?"
"polite","I\'m not sure what the distinction is that you\'re making. What do you want to store, and how do you want to retrieve it?"
"polite","The solution reported in the issue report is to replace any occurrence of `unset($form[$id])` with `$form[$id] = array(\'#language\' => NULL)` in the module file; it just a matter of doing a \""search and replace\"" on a file. What do you exactly don\'t understand?"
"polite","are you using the webSockets API? and is this going to be open sourced at all?"
"polite","http://search.cpan.org/~rgarcia/perl-5.10.0-RC2/pod/perlcall.pod#G_KEEPERR explains the `\'(in cleanup)\'` mechanism, http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.2/ext/XS-APItest/t/call.t shows using it.  this is all XS related, but maybe it will help point you or someone else to a pure perl answer?"
"polite","I\'ve never heard that. Any links to horror stories?"
"polite","by \""without a public facing server\"" do you mean the kml *has* to be on the local machine, or that you don\'t want to have to bother with installing/configuring/buying a public website? And, does the custom map you want to make need to be seen by others or just you?"
"polite","I\'ve seen this happen when my application crashes. If you run your app without breakpoints, do you experience a crash?"
"polite","I am not sure I fully understand the question, is it like having to make 2 piles of different units that will be the closest in total construction time ? With the only constraint that piles cannot exceed 5 elements?"
"polite","i didn\'t think to look for the borders, it\'s a nice idea. but how can i distinguish between other borders that the image contains?"
"polite","please clarify the scenario please. What exactly is the purpose of finding out?"
"polite","it is exactly what I want. please how can I do this ?"
"polite","i want to insert data whole data of array into vector of a map without using for loops. is it possible to push back data set into vector of map?"
"polite","Thanks @BMitch, would you suggest the spray insulation (sorry not sure of the correct term). Or would that be too compact and not work for sound proofing?"
"polite","A quick google search shows lots of good free generators. Are you looking for anything in particular?"
"polite","Thank you for your answer.I\'m a beginner in Android so can you please explain what the meaning of root the phone and set it as S-OFF? also, how shall I do it?"
"polite","You might want to add more context to the question (although it\'s been fairly well answered below :-) I.e. why do you want to do this?"
"polite","So you mean you just can\'t use date functions, yes? Presumably comparison, multiplication and subtraction are okay? :-)"
"polite","If you prepare slightly smaller images, I\'ll insert them in your question. Also, what\'s that thing with truncated titles in your screenshots?"
"polite","What would you like in the case of, e.g., `http://example.com/test.php?key=val` ? Or `http://example.com/test.htm#section1` ?"
"polite","@Paul R: Ok, I have edited my question. Is it better now or something is missing?"
"polite","What type of device will be doing the dropping?  ASA, IPTables, WFP, ect?"
"polite","Good advice, @Spacedman. Care to write that down in a form of an answer so I can upvote you?"
"polite","Since you mentioned that P is PCP(0, log n), I\'d like to add that it is also PCP(0, 0), PCP(0, log log n), etc. How does such a characterization help separate it from NP?"
"polite","Yes, the edges are always axis aligned (I will update the post).  Could you give more detail on the scan line approach?  Thx."
"polite","Could you clarify what you mean by #4? Does this mean that the lists of objects on each edge leading away from node _X_ are always a subset of the list of objects on the edge leading towards _X_?"
"polite","think this is too time localised to be on-topic. Any other thoughts?"
"polite","Pathauto is able to handle that. Have you tried it ?"
"polite","+1 - very welcome update for an inspiring simple yet really entertaining game; given your new employment I\'ve long expected this transition, free-time project or not ;) One question though: why do you have to \'add/enable\' new sites?

"polite","What have you tried so far?  What problems have you encountered?"
"polite","It would really help the many viewers of this question if you would edit it to be clear without having to follow links.  And what is DPAPT?"
"polite","Hello Narendra. What is your question, exactly?"

"polite","Is your intention to stop and then shoot? Or are you also looking for firing ranges that allow bicycles?"
"polite","Not what\'s commonly observed -- on the contrary an often heard complaint is that `print` statements from various threads get all mixed up.  What platform, OS and version, Python version, etc?"
"polite","I don\'t think this is possible as written. When N is very large, the expected product of widely separated xi must be very close to zero, and we can find a set of 1/p + 1 that must essentially be mutually exclusive despite all having probability p.

"polite","how you show imges from lazyload in listview\'s image ? can you post your code please ?"

"polite","I agree, how did you come up with the problem in the first place? I would have thought the idea for a thesis would have come from a real world problem that needs solving?"
"polite","Internet Explorer may cause that. Can you check IE permissions please?"
"polite","I\'m having a little trouble following your description; do you want an algorithm to find graph automorphisms?  Or one to test whether a given permutation is an automorphism?"
"polite","A regular `<img src=\""URL\"" />` worked for me, but it was an image that I hosted off-site. That doesn\'t work for you?"
"polite","bring what back? how are bluetooth and killing processes related?"
"polite","I am using the 3.x Python version.  I figured that since I am new to the language, I should try to learn the newest version - is that faulty logic?"
"polite","I\'m sorry, I don\'t understand your question. Maybe you could post a sample of the code that works properly, and the code that doesn\'t?"
"polite","Do you think the term standard means this is THE standard today ? Isn\'t it like asking why principal component are \""principal\"" and not secondary ?"
"polite","I had really hoped to get some more opinions on this question. I modified it a bit, possibly vote to reopen?"
"polite","@Caf, you are right. What was I thinking?"
"polite","I don\'t know of a specific resource, but if you have specific questions I may be able to help a little.  Are you using WER?"
"polite","If you only want a finite number N of oracles, you could define an N-in-1 compound oracle by using the first log(N) bits of the compound oracle to indicate which suboracle you wish to query. Am I missing something?"
"polite","Maybe show some code and/or image examples. If compatibility is important, have you considered using an animated GIF?"
"polite","Thanks for your answer. Could you expand on what 2 hot wires are? Does that mean 2 live wires?"
"polite","Just iterating.  Though I\'m curious, what would be the difference in approach?"
"polite","That\'s a very appealing recipe by the way. Do you have a cast iron waffle iron? What are you using to cook them?"
"polite","$N$ is not know? Could you please confirm?"
"polite","Is it possible that you\'re caching values that some code paths don\'t actually use?  Could you be caching things that are only used once?"
"polite","please provide a more detailed example, because I don\'t understand what you mean by concatenating objects. I know what it means for strings: `\""a\"" + \""b\""` => `\""ab\""`, But what should the resulting Object (Person) look like?"
"polite","Ah, well, I forgot that I also did subclass the view object associated with my NSCollectionViewItem subclass while I was working on this today. Perhaps that broke something?"
"polite","My first impression is that it is indeed with the StackPanel, since it\'s default is to \""shrink\"" around elements.  Have you tried using a fixed size container and adjusting the width, if needed, as part of the animation?"
"polite","This sounds like an open ended hardware request, which is likely to get your question closed. Can you make your question any more specific?"
"polite","Yeah, it\'s difficult to tell what the columns mean from their names. Can you add more explanation of how the tables fit together?"
"polite","I can\'t parse the For example part.  Can you provide a clearer example?"
"polite","How about this: \""Probably a lot, I had better get started (pull out a pad and pencil) What will you be eating for dinner tonight? (start writing) Okay, well I better get on the phone to find out about everyone else, what is the long distance code for your phones?\"""

"polite","Well, the title may say it all but _\""all\""_ isn\'t enough for me to understand what you are asking. Can you please elaborate?"
"polite","This is a pretty broad question to write out code for. What part of the process specifically are you having trouble with?"
"polite","Can you please clarify, if you only care about the weights, why you don\'t simply do `data[x] += w`? What do you care about besides the weights?"
"polite","That\'s a good idea, and then use default parameter window = NULL?  Are there other methods?"
"polite","Nice.. you have almost give us enough details, last question. What is that `System.out.println(e.getCause().toString());` call printing?"
"polite","Thank you for your answer. For the acidic rub, do you mean like lemon juice? Or more like yoghurt to permeate/tenderize the meat?"
"polite","Please provide code and a specific question. What have you tried?"
"polite","Welcome to Bicycles.SE! Your question is quite similar to [What are the utmost important things to bring on a ride?- Is there anything you\'re looking to find out that\'s not already addressed in this earlier question?"
"polite","Could you please state your initial problem at what you are trying to achieve. Also please explain what do you mean by graphing interactions, graphing the different regression lines, plotting the coefficient values?"
"polite","Ah, okay. Perhaps you can edit your original question and add that extra info in there?"
"polite","Perhaps you could explain why you believe that these *should* be related? Do you have any evidence that supports this belief?"
"polite","You\'ll need to be more specific about your example in (c).  What are complete sentences/contexts that you use one of these two phrases, and why is one closer to German?"
"polite","+1 timely question, but you might clarify \""practical in the real world within the next two years\"": it exists, can be used for many of the tasks that perl5 is useful for, has lots of nice improvements (rules being my favourite), and does look on track for release in tha time.  So what\'s your threshold?"
"polite","Any chance the wire between the switch and the ceiling is 2000ft. long? ;p"
"polite","this seems like an interesting question, but I can\'t make heads or tails of it.  Do you think you could edit it to explain in more depth, perhaps including links to some of the more technical terms?"
"polite","Yes it does, but the weird thing it\'s that all the other user attributes are getting passed (When i take a look at the console, every other value but the client_id hash it\'s getting passed from the form). Do you think that the fact that I\'m also using authlogic for this same model may be something to do with it?"
"polite","putting the keyword (with special character) in quotes does not work. is there any other methods?"
"polite","@joelt -- good point, which I think is the ultimate debate going on now by the answerers below, but I would like to know (@everyone) how much of a difference is it at the beginning until they converge?  How significant is it to affect the resulting algorithm?"
"polite","This should be a pretty straightforward adaptation of the existing algorithms you linked. Can you post what you have and we can help you along with hints?"
"polite","Hello Erin, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which Drupal version are you interested?"
"polite","I believe that almost all jQuery plugins can work with a ListView. Could you show any code where you attempt to use gallery with a ListView?"
"polite","Please describe, what happens if you try to boot. What boot options are used?"
"polite","Depending on the CUDA version you are using, device emulation may not be available, as it has been deprecated and possibly removed.  Is it feasible to get another GPU (a cheap one for display maybe)?"

"polite","Is the array supposed to be dynamic? i.e. you can update the array after the pre-process step?"
"polite","When displayed, the menu link will use the defined path alias. Any reason why this isn\'t enough?"
"polite","Please, be more specific. Where do you want to display pictures, what kind of pictures?"
"polite","@Thanatos: Interesting, however that statement implies that there are no multibyte string encodings that have embedded null bytes? Is that correct?"
"polite","Thanks for the detailed answer, that\'s really helpful. Is there a way to recognise double/triple butted tubes on eg used frames? Can you hear the thickness change by flicking it with a fingernail?"
"polite","Sure. Can you describe such a enumeration? :)"
"polite","I agree, The question is almost claiming that you can\'t debug with a debugger in an IDE this is not the case. You can run a debugger with or without an IDE, I\'m sure he knows that though :) Maybe he is asking about visual debuggers specificly?"
"polite","Its related to an algorithm for finding unique sets of a given number of items, so I just wanted to know if that had a name or if I was already looking at it.  Is my question still off topic?"
"polite","Am I correct in thinking that you only are interested in paths having minimum edge count across all paths?  I.e. if there exists a path with weights (2, 2, 2), you\'re not interested in the path (5, 6, 7, 8), right?"
"polite","So, if I understand the issue, you need to find the superset of the vertices and get the centroid of each set therein. Then create every plane that intersects every two of those along with the centroid of the simplex... is that right?"
"polite","High level questions are fine, but this one is really broad. It would help if you could narrow your question to something a little more specific or provide more context?"
"polite","@chaman, sorry I can\'t figure out what exactly it is you want. Are we talking about the chapter title that only appears once, such as \""1 Introduction\"" or do you want to know how to change your heading that appear on every page of the chapter?"
"polite","That\'s what I thought. :) Well, what is solution for safe managing lua_State*?"
"polite","sorry, wasn\'t really thinking about a definitive question. could we just say that my question is: is my interpretation valid or does it contain some problems?"
"polite","It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Do you have a user, entering a name and address, and you are going to show him all similar addresses to let him choose one manually, or are you going to group all Persons with similar addresses automatically together?"
"polite","You try thinking of algorithms (either new ones or ones you know) that satisfy the constraint, discarding the ones that don\'t. :-) Do you have specific examples?"
"polite","I found [this little recipe](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576420-get-a-posix-timestamp-from-a-type-1-uuid/) in Python. Since I\'m not good at Ruby, could someone make this for Ruby please?"
"polite","Do you mean the launcher? Could you please provide a screenshot?"
"polite","Interesting problem.  What have you tried so far, and where are you stuck?"
"polite","In general, the first field on a line can be empty, in which case it could start with a comma.  So, how do you know when the lines need to be combined?"
"polite","You\'ll have to give us a bit more context here.  Can you provide a code snippet that displays this problem?"
"polite","I guess you could have mis-typed the name of the textbox control. Is it TextBox1? :)"
"polite","What language is this? (apologies for ignorance, assuming C#?)"
"polite","Is the image in the Oracle database or is it a path to the image? Could you provide a code sample?"
"polite","@GoodEnough It\'s not about other people reading your mail but about giving Google all your data. You now, *Do be evil* (or how was their slogan?)."
"polite","I like your idea of relativ dimensions and positions. What didn\'t work well?"
"polite","What are you trying to say? You want a Registry Editor?"
"polite","Try to add an `import pycuda` line at the top of your script. Does it help?"
"polite","Is location important, or are you just looking for a hierarchy?  I see you are going to be using \""categorization by location\"", but are you planning on using attributes (like a lookup table) or a spatial search (like \""what\'s near me\"")?"
"polite","Please share some recipies of those pastas/1 dish meals?"
"polite","@Mr.TAMER, I personally would like to know the latter. Would you mind to post a link for that?"
"polite","Is there any real world current sources? How can I implement a current source from a voltage source?"
"polite","Thanks Cameron.  That makes sense, but then why isn\'t this access restricted to only copy constructors and assignment operators?"
"polite","The very easiest way to tag an image is to use the Alt Text in picture\'s properties, but I have a feeling this isn\'t what you want based on your example. Can you describe more about not only what you want but how you plan to achieve it?"
"polite","the ability to read and write in Korean. (including in the source) So are you writing this from scratch or modifying an existing one?"
"polite","Thanks.  BTW, should I mince the parsley before frying it?"
"polite","The best case would be if the list were already sorted but I don\'t think that\'s what you\'re asking. Could you be more specific?"
"polite","I may be missing something but I agree with @whuber. I do not see why you need an approximation g(x) when you have h(x)^+ and in what sense will any other function g(x) be better than h(x)^+?"
"polite","You added the tag [approximation-hardness].  Can you elaborate on how this question is related to hardness of approximation, preferably in the question?"
"polite","@Micheal- Thanks.Could you please elaborate on how I could set this up?"
"polite","Could you please describe in more detail what do you mean? Perhaps include a drawing?"
"polite","Your example above works for me. What kind of output are you getting?"
"polite","Hello user1293, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which Drupal version are you interested?"
"polite","@bvr @chambwez I think my code is working fine now :) My last question would be, is session handling possible in XMLRPC? How do I maintain a stateful transmission between the client and the server?"
"polite","Thanks for the answer do you know of anything I could use for the fixings with the foundations?"
"polite","Not sure what you\'re asking exactly.  Can you give an example of sample input and output?"
"polite","@George, will this work in Fedora 15 under the new Gnome 3? Is it in the repositories?"
"polite","Default search comes with user search. You can\'t use that?"
"polite","The question is ambiguous. Can you please be more specific?"
"polite","@zildjohn01, What\'s the best way to do this (which PHP functions?). Could you leave a detailed answer with your approach?"
"polite","OT : Is my edit of the post a good way to add on-topic questions? What do you suggest else?"
"polite","Thanks, I forgot to add this . Where shall I add it in the list ?"
"polite","Some otherwise useless kitchen gadgets might have other valid uses.  I never use a garlic press (just another thing to clean, when I can crush it with the side of my knife), but they can make play-doh hair (or really small noodles?)"
"polite","in certain cases i had to first start the Zune player and then VS2010 to make it work. Perhaps that does the trick for you?"
"polite","Thanks for the info, this is enlightening. A followup question - with panniers do you find it necessary to use a pair with the content\'s weight somewhat balanced between the sides?"
"polite","Good question! What formula did you attempt, and in what situations was it wrong?"
"polite","Sorry about that, clicked on that box without thinking.  Can I remove that status at this point though?"
"polite","I\'ve gotten that and I remember it went away after a few seconds and then the app would eventually launch.  Are you getting that?"
"polite","Please post the actual compiler message. Does the error occur with minimal source files (just the mentioned lines without the stuff implied by ...)?"
"polite","@robertc - thanks for the reply. I don\'t know how to answer your question - what should I look for?"
"polite","Thanks a lot steve, I\'m trying to implement the pseudo-code line by line very carefully, there is an extended pseudo-code that\'s written more clearly here: http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-0430102-111906/unrestricted/corourke.pdf  on page 27, I\'m coding that carefully and i\'m testing it with some sample answers given by NTRU, I think i\'m also getting held back in understanding the pseudo-code, in my code I gave a fixed length and set of values to the polynomial f, and the infinite loop on 8-31 never ended, thanks for pointing out that f is a variable. Any more tricks to watch out for?"
"polite","It seems to work fine for me.  Can you check if there is any place that is doing a HtmlEncode() replacement on hlNonTerminal.Attributes[\""onclick\""]?"
"polite","Thanks! How much batter do you use for each shell?"
"polite","Out of curiosity, why would a user choose to disable multitasking (i.e. what\'s the tradeoff)?"
"polite","Sorry if this is obvious, but what is `dn`? Is that a constant multiplied by `n`?"
"polite","I think we need a bit more context here. Exactly what type of graph do you want?"
"polite","I\'ve never heard of either of those.  What country are you in?"
"polite","Did you ever get this resolved successfully? Do you still need help with this?"
"polite","Just looking at it, it looks like a skewed normal distribution. Are you sure the outliers are necessary for your analysis?"
"polite","Eh. Fresh pasta takes less than 3 minutes to cook in boiling water. Why would you need to microwave this?"
"polite","Please can you show the exact code that fails, for example, if this is in a view, paste in the relevant part.  Is it \""<%= sanitized_text(truncate(msword_text)) %>\"" that fails and \""<%= sanitized_text(msword_text) %> that is okay?"
"polite","native?  You compile to the microcode for your particular processor or the generic x86 instruction set?"
"polite","This is quite cool, I\'d almost consider suggesting the ability to encrypt the answers to your question for a day on user voice with a clickable \""decrypt\"" link or something. What do other think?"
"polite","You can construct a unique Binary Search Tree given any two traversals, are you looking to do that or are you in search of something else?
If not please elaborate what you mean by non unique trees?"
"polite","wow, that\'s perfect.  any one have any suggested \""appliances\"" that they like to use?"
"polite","Hi, could you provide a bit more detailed explanation with your code?  The part \""i need a certain area of the screen to be drawn in my app\"" I understood, but you could at least try to explain a bit the code you posted and give a small working example?"
"polite","Fine, thanks a lot. Can you please provide the link for downloading the CD cache for the ubuntu version 10.10 ?"
"polite","Great question, but I\'m not sure stackoverflow is the right place to ask it. Maybe this would be better-suited for programmers.SE.com?"
"polite","Welcome to the site! Are the rims the same size on both bikes?"
"polite","What is an eastern style pot?  Is this a cup-like device with a lid to strain out the leaves (sorry, don\'t know the name), or something else entirely?"
"polite","What does \""visible to cities\"" mean? What range?"
"polite","Please be a bit more precise.  What language are you developing in?"
"polite","You\'re brilliant. Thanks :) Now could you just tell me how to make the view show the fields as rows, not columns?"
"polite","@Firebrandt: Could you, please, add the clarification what you meant by better in your question. What do you mean by outlining the solution - how to fill table entries in the table from Garey and Johnson book?"
"polite","Rainer -- thanks. Perhaps you could post an answer with your changes made so that I could see them?"
"polite","So how on earth do I overwrite the existing files without deleting all of the custom content? (CSS, markup, etc?)"
"polite","@TLP thanks for the explanation. So `@returned` is `$data_structure_reference`, right?"
"polite","What do you have in mind with \""Algorithmic approaches\""? I gave some examples of applications in my answer, is that what you are looking for?"
"polite","@Gilles Sorry for touching such an old issue, but it looks very interesting! Do I understand it right, that something like `ionice` would do more good?"
"polite","welcome to stackoverflow. what language are you trying to do this in?"
"polite","@spinning_plate - These are useful links. Do you know by any chance if parallelizing the computation will speed up the processing and if so how can a graph traversal problem like this be broken down into smaller pieces computable on numerous machines?"
"polite","I\'m sorry, but I do feel that this is *way* off-topic for a [programming/scripting website](http://stackoverflow.com/faq/). Perhaps [Super User](http://superuser.com/) might be a better fit; or [Doctype](http://doctype.com/)?"
"polite","Great question. What exactly do you mean by \""bug\""?"
"polite","Sorry I didn\'t mentioned it, but it\'s tab separated... It is possible to quickly replace the \',\' by a \'.\' in the code or do I have to replace it with notepad++ or something?"
"polite","Thanks, though. This was a much more interesting question than \""how do you make a positive number negative in C#?\"""
"polite","I just tried this bc I was thinking along the same lines but for some reason when I implement with my data1.csv file it makes no difference, I think it is because of userID numbering and lettering. Is possible for me to send you the data file, so you can see what I mean?"
"polite","This is a cool question!  Where did this come up?"
"polite","Seems very similar to http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/1634/which-instant-messaging-services-use-or-allow-secure-protocols-and-what-do-those - but there may be a slightly different goal here.  @LanceBaynes - Could you elaborate a bit, particularly in a way that distinguishes this question from the other?"
"polite","sorry guys, i actually don\'t really know what acceptance that you guys mentioned. Can you guys explain please?"
"polite","Sure, no problem. Jeste?? z Warszawy?"
"polite","What do you actually want? Check if a certificate is valid, or force `wget` to connect only if a certificate is valid?"
"polite","Nice question!.  Which specific terms do you understand and which ones do you not understand?"
"polite","Perhaps rephrase it to something like, \""What do you look for when choosing a distribution?\"", or \""Which distribution would best suit scenario X?\"""
"polite","Oops, this was meant to be on Stack Overflow. Can someone migrate it please?"
"polite","I know what KMP stands for but not BM. Would you mind writing down what each of them stands for, in case others don\'t know?"
"polite","@Sriram : yup I will think of it on a small scale first ..then perhaps later will look into the bigger picture :-) ..thanks for ur suggestions !! :-)  so what do u feel hw should one get started with this ?"
"polite","Thanks, will check that out. Is there a advantage/disadvantage using setjmp/longjmp over signals as proposed below?"
"polite","Sorry to up this, I found it via google, but it seems to work when the private static final field is a primitive type. Does anyone have an idea why ?"
"polite","Maybe it\'s better just to ask and to provide some rules like: one suggestion per answer, use voting on exisiting ones. Or is this the meaning of community wiki already?"
"polite","The project page you linked provides a fairly specific overview of what the module does. Do you have specific questions about why a module would depend on it other than what they lay out there?"
"polite","Can you be more precise about what exactly the system needs to achieve? Something like \""Given X initial data, output Y\""?"
"polite","Can you elaborate? An example maybe?"
"polite","At least there\'s nothing ungrammatical about them. Could you elaborate on why you have doubts about their correctness?"
"polite","Please, show your code. How do you toggle this form?"
"polite","There are lots and lots of rational fraction libraries.  What language would you like to know about?"
"polite","thank you for that. Do you think it is possible it just is the limit screws?"
"polite","@cjm: Good point.  Are you creating this PDF yourself, or is it from some 3rd party?"
"polite","Please elaborate: UI design or general software architecture design? Or anything else?"
"polite","Good question. I wonder if it should be migrated to CS Theory (http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) or Programmers (http://programmers.stackexchange.com/) ?"
"polite","Since you mentioned Evil Maid by Joanna, you already know the answer to your question. Am I missing something here?"
"polite","Yes, that is the real source code. And the compilation has been performed without optimization, perhaps that is the reason?"
"polite","I\'d like to support iOS 3.0 because it\'s the project\'s requirement. Can you help?"
"polite","How are you getting your data? ArcGIS Server feeds? SDE?"
"polite","Are you looking for something that gives you a global view? For instance to see the difference in load time from Texas and Tokyo?"
"polite","I don\'t think it needs the Homework tag, as even though this is homework, the question and answer would be the same regardless of the source. Do other people have to tag their questions in regards to their current occupation on the project?"
"polite","Yes, it is an option, but I have no experience using them. Can you direct me to the correct libraries so I can have a look at them ?"
"polite","Please read this again: \""you can use the amount of time it takes for it to invalidate you help guess if part of your credentials are correct\"". Aren\'t you missing something there?"
"polite","Good point Dan. instead of the OK/Cancel stuff, have you (user583126) considered a < noscript > solution?"

"polite","Can you please paste the code where you read the integers? Also, what compiler are you using, and on which platform?"
"polite","Hello, Ruben; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. For which Drupal version are you asking the question?"

"polite","ooops, sorry i re-edited my post. can you please validate it with the .xml doc i just posted it ?"
"polite","I\'ve got a million files of log with sequentially updated numbered timestamps, but same filesizes for some. What is a good way to maintain only one copy of each logfile?"
"polite","You say you don\'t want multisite, and then when someone mentions multisite you say it\'s a good idea? \""Different pages with different things on them\""... is this a joke question?"
"polite","I have seen \'webform-revisions\' module, but it solves nothing to me. Have you got that functionality working?"
"polite","good question.  
Is the JVM open source (hotspot) or are the cools such as the javac compiler open source as well?"

"polite","@hade @Dogbert I have updated the original post. Is this helpful information?"

"polite","@Jakub Hampl: At my current stage of design, it is more of a logic based game rather than an animation driven game. Out of curiosity, could you expand on the more powerful topic you were mentioning?"
"polite","I\'ve always been under the impression that most quick-sort implementations will switch to merge sort after descending a predetermined number of levels of recursion. Would you mind posting your code to see areas for improvement?"
"polite","I have the same issue.. This has worked for me in the past. Did you find a solution yet?"
"polite","@Lukas I\'m faced with a similar problem at the moment. Did you ever find a good solution?"

"polite","It doesn\'t increase exponentially (a^x); it increases quadratically (x^2).  Can you correct the title?"
"polite","The reason for using \""Please try not to eat the semicolon\"" was simply because I couldn\'t come up with a better example. Would there be any difference if it was related?"
"polite","Nice! Looks like a good book. Do you suppose you might be able to list some of the more advanced techniques they describe, or provide an excerpt?"
"polite","Thanks. are you suggesting that might be the source of my problem, or is just a general best practice?"
"polite","@hop: i didn\'t know about the fallback, thanks for reference. I think you meant RFC 2821?"
"polite","Hi, thanks for the bounty. I wonder, did things turn out OK?"
"polite","Wow, that is a great answer!  Thanks for the answer.  One more question for you though.  How can I tell what the float of the pedal is?"

"polite","another great example for how google makes you stupid. does nobody ever read the documentation anymore?"
"polite","I think it would be excellent if you could give more detail (see suncoolsu\'s answer). Furthermore, with design, do you mean how to analyze the data?"

"polite","Hi @OZ_ - can you educate me as to why? Is there a better way to store images?"

"polite","Thanks for the response. I\'m looking for a way to do something like record a route and submit that. Do you know of anything like that?"

"polite","I love it. Two immediate thoughts (1) what about mapping the space based on probabilities (2) what would a scheme to try and identify the or incorrect answers look like?"
"polite","I\'m suspecting a bad charger; most home screen I\'ve used turns itself on when you just plugged the device in or plugged the device out, if a bad charger somehow causes the device to think that it had just been plugged off and/or plugged on, it could cause the symptoms you\'re having. Have you tried with a different charger and different wall socket?"
"polite","@Steve McFarlin, thanks, you have any tips on reading except the qt-documentation to grasp the whole structure of the mov-file because i\'m really having trouble gripping all of it, is it correct that the atom don\'t even need to be in a specific order? which one did you think was easiest to work with mov or mp4?"

"polite","Welcome to Stack Overflow!  Can you be a bit more specific about what you\'ve tried before, what problems you\'ve run into, and what we can help you with?"

"polite","An API is not at fault if they allow requests to take place more than 30 time in 5 seconds, right?  Or do we need to build throttling into our API?"
"polite","I\'m sorry, but I\'m really struggling to understand what the problem is. Would you mind rephrasing the text after the first code sample?"
"polite","I\'m sure there is a way to tackle this problem, but we\'ll need more information. Can you try explaining the issue a bit more thoroughly?"

"polite","I know `in` is a keyword, used in loops, is it a method too? If so, can you give us an example of usage?"
