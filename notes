First Approach:

Classifying requests according to words.

For each word, collect the politeness score assigned to the request in which it occurs.
Create a collection of (word, list of scores)
average list of scores for each word to get (word, average score) for each score.

For testing:
request is polite if:
Prob(polite | request) > Prob(Impolite | request)
or Prob(request | polite) Prob(polite) > Prob(request | impolite) Prob(impolite)
or Prob(request | polite) > Polite(request | impolite)
or summation (Prob(word | polite)) > summation (Prob(word | impolite))
