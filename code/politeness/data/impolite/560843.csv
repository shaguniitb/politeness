"Re: <url> and <url>, if you think they are better off as redirects to the suburb/town rather than substubs on the lakes with a <nowiki><person></nowiki> tagline, you only need to overwrite the article with a redirect (or revert to a previous version that was a redirect), leaving the substub in the article history. How come you speedied them before redirecting?"	0	0	3	1	6
