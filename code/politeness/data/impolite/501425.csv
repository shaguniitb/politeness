I don't understand why Hong is so reluctant to revert unilateral changes from time-to-time when he did so frequently in the past when I or someone else who supported my edits did it. What exactly is the point in me agreeing to this if someone conveniently comes along and then starts making lots of changes that I don't like but Giovanni doesn't mind?,0,0,1,5,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
