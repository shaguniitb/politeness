"#I am still convinced the long page on ""prostatitis"" (a misnomer in the case of CPPS) is confusing, with too many sections and subsections, and would benefit from restructuring and the creation of separate pages for each area, or at the very least the removal of the CPPS section to its own, in depth page. You were the only editor to object to this going ahead, with this comment: ""So, suggest keep this on hold for now, but in principle one might similarly split off other classification categories with this then just umbrella simple introduction."" Do you still hold this view?"	0	0	2	3	5
