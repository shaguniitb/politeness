"Dear commander, this source: '''* Berg, Ole F.: <person>, Oslo 1997 ISBN 82-993545-2-8''' is a Norwegian source, as signified by the lang|no tag, hence the first letters of months is not supposed to be capital. I thought that tagging sources with lang|no would prevent this problem, isn't that correct?"	0	0	3	1	4
