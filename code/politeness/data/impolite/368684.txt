note kurts talk page almost certainly isnt a good place to seek a broad or unbiased consensus on this question nor is it the appropriate venue in which to request an exemption from a ban mdash and in all honesty im not sure that managing such an exemption for the purpose of posting gags would be a constructive use of anyones time  perhaps it would be best to save the jokes for a time when youre once again allowed to edit in the wp namespace or post whatever jokes you wish within reason in your own user space
