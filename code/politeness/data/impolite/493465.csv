So what exactly was the point in moving 'Birmingham New Street Station' to 'Birmingham New Street railway station' I've never heard it called that before nor any other of the Birmingham stations. Is there any need to add 'railway' to the title of a station unless it is being disambiguated from a bus station or something?,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
