The Munich Agreement: ‘Peace for our Time’

Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain flew into Hendon Aerodrome following his meeting with Hitler in Munich.
“…the settlement of the Czechoslovakian problem, which has now been achieved is, in my view, only the prelude to a larger settlement in which all Europe may find peace. This morning I had another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler, and here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine (waves paper to the crowd – receiving loud cheers and “Hear Hears”). Some of you, perhaps, have already heard what it contains but I would just like to read it to you …”.
It was not until later in the day, outside 10 Downing Street that he used the phrase ‘peace for our time’…
My good friends, for the second time in our history, a British Prime Minister has returned from Germany bringing peace with honour. I believe it is peace for our time.
The phrase became popularly reinterpreted as the expression ‘peace in our time‘.
