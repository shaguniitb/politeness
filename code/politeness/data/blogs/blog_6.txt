For a change ... Justin Bieber's a little camera shy, at least when it comes to sitting for a videotaped deposition in his legal battle with a Miami paparazzo ... TMZ has learned.

TMZ broke the story ... Bieber is being sued by Jeffrey Binion, the pap who claims one of Bieber's thugs choked him and stole his camera equipment back in June.

Binion's attorney is set to grill Justin in a videotaped deposition next month -- and Bieber's responded with a legal request for the depo to be kept under lock and key.

According to the docs, Bieber's lawyers feel "it is highly likely that the entire deposition will be published to the public." Their concern is the questioning will include lots of topics unrelated to the case.

Translation: they don't want a video of Justin talking about all his juvenile antics getting out to the world.

Team Bieber is requesting that no copies be made of the original recording. They also want to handpick the videographer.

We know some guys ... if they need a recommendation.
