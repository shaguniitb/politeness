hey mbk well ive got to be honest i wasnt expecting the events of last night  personally i thought the discussion was going reasonably well not fabulously but we were getting somewhere and whilst i agree that mlms actions werent exactly advised i must admit it does seem to be a relatively minor thing to retire over  was there something else going on here that made it the straw that broke his back anyhow i agree with you that hell be greatly missed  i sent him a message on nsf but i doubt if ill get any reply  what are your thoughts on the matter
