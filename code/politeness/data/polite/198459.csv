"Thanks for taking all that on....just wondering on the template if that Vancouver / North LM split vs Fraser Valley South LM split is something Elections BC cooked up; ""North"" and ""South"" just don't seem right geographically/compass-wise, it's more like ""West"" and East"".....I'm imagine there's reason to your rhyme; dito Vancouver Island/South Coast which is a-geographical somewhat if North Island is included (the Queen Charlotte Strait region is part of the Central Coast).  If those are divisions used by Elections BC I guess that's what it is, though....I can make some additions to various pages describing the changes relating to ridings they're made out of and waht areas are in/out in each case.....and since the districts were created in 2008, shouldn't hte title say that instead of 2009?"
