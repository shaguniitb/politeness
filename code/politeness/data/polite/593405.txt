just a question about the maintenance categories that femtobot automatically creates each month ive noticed that the bot is frequently forced to recreate old longdeleted monthly categories in the person queue because an article got reverted to an old version for one reason or another and resulted in the old category being temporarily repopulated again im just putting this forward as an idea for discussion and am certainly not wedded to it u2014 but just to keep things simpler for everyone i wonder what you would think about the feasibility andor desirability of recoding the bot so that when it encounters a repopulated old maintenance category it would retag the article to the current month instead of recreating the old one
