"The Birr page looks good now... but, it seems a little strange to make a distinction between Abyssinia and Ethiopia, as if they were two different entities.  The native name was ''ityoppya'' (Ethiopia) long before 1931; in that year, the Emperor formally requested the international community to begin using Ethiopia instead of Abyssinia, much as the Shah, around the same time, requested the use of ""Iran"" instead of ""Persia"" for his country (and it was also around this time that Siam became Thailand, I believe...) Anyway, it might make more sense for one box reading ""Abyssinia / Ethiopia"" in place of the two separate boxes...?",0,0,4,4,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
