"I would be willing to move this article to the incubator so that it can be worked on (I agree it wouldn't be an A7 today), though if it's to be made into a real article it needs to be done with someone with no conflict of interest regarding the subject, as creating articles for things you own is highly discouraged.  If I undelete it to the incubator would you agree to let it go and leave it up to other users without a conflict of interest?"
