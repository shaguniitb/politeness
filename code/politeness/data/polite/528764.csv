"Except for the one about the Chevrolet Monza bit at the middle which came from the Prototype book, was in fact come from the Brumos website, but the last time I read that was back in February 2001. Also is with the referencing, the page is now a total mess, is there a way that could be sorted out, I would be very thankful if you could help?"	1	0	2	2	3
