"Hi I noticed that you changed the category at <url> from ""People from Alabama"" to ""People from Elmore County, Alabama"". Is this appropriate, as Opothleyahola was dead for three years before Elmore county had been organized and had been forcibly removed from the area more than thirty years before?"
