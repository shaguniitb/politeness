"Hey MBK; well, I've got to be honest I wasn't expecting the events of last night - personally I thought the discussion was going reasonably well (not fabulously, but we were getting somewhere) and, whilst I agree that Mlm's actions weren't exactly advised, I must admit it does seem to be a relatively minor thing to retire over - was there something else going on here that made it the straw that broke his back? Anyhow, I agree with you that he'll be greatly missed - I sent him a message on NSF but I doubt if I'll get any reply - what are your thoughts on the matter?",0,0,3,6,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
