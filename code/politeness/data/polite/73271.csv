"I don't follow you I was not aware that my edits were vandalism, I was editing according to what had (it appeared to me) been agreed on the talk page, but additional material had been inserted (that had not been agreed upon)  that esentialy said the same thing (and was not supported by the sources) that had caused the origioanl disagrement. I think I may have mis-understood you point, are you saying that I can only revert three times if its vandalism, or that my edits were vandalims?"	0	0	2	2	6
