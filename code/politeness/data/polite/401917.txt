i would be willing to move this article to the incubator so that it can be worked on i agree it wouldnt be an a7 today though if its to be made into a real article it needs to be done with someone with no conflict of interest regarding the subject as creating articles for things you own is highly discouraged  if i undelete it to the incubator would you agree to let it go and leave it up to other users without a conflict of interest
