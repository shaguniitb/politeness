"Problem is how do you recognise the categories, as there are thousands of them. I have already made a program that scans the database, and can locate the unstubbed articles, so finding the untagged stubs is ok, and AWB automatically adds the stub tag if the article is short, I just can't think how you could program it to automatically guess the type of stub, any ideas?"
