the birr page looks good now but it seems a little strange to make a distinction between abyssinia and ethiopia as if they were two different entities  the native name was ityoppya ethiopia long before 1931 in that year the emperor formally requested the international community to begin using ethiopia instead of abyssinia much as the shah around the same time requested the use of iran instead of persia for his country and it was also around this time that siam became thailand i believe anyway it might make more sense for one box reading abyssinia  ethiopia in place of the two separate boxes
