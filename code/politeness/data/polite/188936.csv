Sorry to bother you but theres a report on <url> regarding <url> which has been a target for IP vandalism. I'm only asking directly  because the vandalism is continuing and I'm close to not being able to fight it anymore under policy so can I ask if you could please issue the protection and revert the IP's vandalism back to my last revision?	0	0	2	4	13
