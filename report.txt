I'm evaluating the results for the file wiki_train.arff. The report files for each experiment set, results files and settings files are in the folder 'experiments'.

Experiment set 1: 
Please see set_1.txt for the results of experiments in this set.
For each of the experiments in this set, I used StringToWordVector filter with settings in `settings_1.txt':

Result:
Instances: 2176
Attributes: 476

I then edited the resulting file to label 'polite/impolite' attribute as class attribute. Further work for each of the experiments is described in set_1.txt.


Experiment set 2: 
Please see set_2.txt for the results of experiments in this set.
For each of the experiments in this set, I used StringToWordVector filter with settings in `settings_2.txt':

Result:
Instances: 2176
Attributes: 467

I then edited the resulting file to label 'polite/impolite' attribute as class attribute. .
Improving this by using AttributeSelection filter:

evaluator: InfoGainAttributeEval
search: Ranker with threshold 0.0

Result:
Attributes: 115

Further work for each of the experiments is described in set_2.txt
