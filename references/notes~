I'm Using weka for the classification.
java -jar weka.jar

First, I selected the SimpleCLI application, and converting data files to ARFF format:
java weka.core.converters.TextDirectoryLoader -dir /home/shagun/politeness/code/politeness/data > wiki_train.arff

Then, I selected the Explorer application of weka.
I preprocessed this ARFF file using various preprocessing techniques made available by weka.
I then trained different classifiers on this processed data, and checked their performance. The results are described in report.txt.
